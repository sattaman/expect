Let agents test your code in a real browser.

One command scans your unstaged changes or branch diff, generates a test plan, and runs it against a live browser.

## Install

```bash
npx -y expect-cli@latest init
```

## Usage

```
Usage: expect-cli [options] [command]

Options:
  -m, --message <instruction>   natural language instruction for what to test
  -f, --flow <slug>             reuse a saved flow by slug
  -y, --yes                     skip plan review, run immediately
  -a, --agent <provider>        agent provider to use (claude, codex, copilot, gemini, cursor, opencode, or droid)
  -t, --target <target>         what to test: unstaged, branch, or changes (default: changes)
  --verbose                     enable verbose logging
  -v, --version                 print version
  -h, --help                    display help

Commands:
  init                          install expect globally and set up skill

Examples:
  $ expect-cli                                          open interactive TUI
  $ expect-cli -m "test the login flow" -y              plan and run immediately
  $ expect-cli --target branch                          test all branch changes
  $ expect-cli --target unstaged                        test unstaged changes

Set `NO_TELEMETRY=1` to disable analytics events.
```

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Scan changes\n(git diff)"] --> B["Generate plan\n(AI agent)"]
    B --> C["Run in browser\n(Playwright)"]
    C --> D["Report\n(pass/fail)"]
```

Expect reads your unstaged changes or branch diff, sends them to an AI agent, and generates a step-by-step test plan describing how to validate the changes. You review and approve the plan in an interactive TUI, then the agent executes each step against a live browser - using your real login sessions so there's no manual auth setup. Every session is recorded so you can replay exactly what happened.

Pass `-y` to skip plan review and run headlessly in CI. Exits `0` on success, `1` on failure.

### Why not ...?

Most of these tools let an agent click around a browser. Expect does that too, but it also reads your diff, writes a test plan, runs it with your real cookies across multiple browsers, and gives you a live view + replay of every session.

## Supported Agents

Expect works with the following coding agents via the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.org):

| Agent                                                         | Flag          | Install                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | `-a claude`   | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)                      | `-a codex`    | `npm install -g @openai/codex`             |
| [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/github/copilot)           | `-a copilot`  | `npm install -g @github/copilot`           |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)     | `-a gemini`   | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`        |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.com)                                  | `-a cursor`   | [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)           |
| [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode)           | `-a opencode` | `npm install -g opencode-ai`               |
| [Factory Droid](https://factory.ai)                           | `-a droid`    | `npm install -g droid`                     |

Expect auto-detects which agents are installed on your `PATH`. If multiple are available, it defaults to the first one found. Use `-a <provider>` to pick a specific agent.
