**Expect** tests your app in a browser so you don't have to.

- Run `/expect` inside Claude Code, Codex, [and more](https://github.com/millionco/expect#supported-agents)
- Spawns agents to simulating real logged-in users to find issues and regressions.
- No more writing Playwright by hand or token-hungry computer use tools. <!-- needs proof -->
- Get video recordings and GitHub Actions out of the box.

### **[Demo →](https://expect.dev)**

## Install

Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

```bash
npx expect-cli@latest init
```

This will guide you through a setup process. Once installed, you can run `/expect` inside Claude Code or Codex to start testing.

## FAQ

#### 1. How is this different from Puppeteer / Playwright / Cypress?

Instead of writing scripts, maintaining selectors, and wiring up assertions, Expect reads your code changes and tests them in a real browser automatically. It's like having giving your agent QA superpowers.

#### 2. How is this different from coding agents or computer-use tools?

Your agent needs to verify its work, and general-purpose browser tools rely on screenshots and mouse coordinates.

Expect is purpose-built for testing: it uses Playwright for fast DOM automation, reads your code changes, generates a test plan, and runs it with your real cookies, then reports back what's broken so the agent can fix it.

#### 3. How does it fit into my workflow?

Your coding agent calls `/expect` as a skill whenever it needs to validate its work in a real browser. You can also trigger it from CI by adding the GitHub Action to test every PR automatically before merge.

#### 5. Does it work in CI?

Yes. Use `--ci` or the `add github-action` command to set up a workflow that tests every PR. In CI mode it runs headless, skips cookie extraction, auto-approves the plan, and enforces a 30-minute timeout.

#### 6. Can this do mobile / desktop testing?

Coming soon.

#### 7. Is there a cloud or enterprise version?

Coming soon. Email [aiden@million.dev](mailto:aiden@million.dev) if you have questions or ideas.

## Supported Agents

Expect works with the following coding agents. It auto-detects which agents are installed on your `PATH`. If multiple are available, it defaults to the first one found. Use `-a <provider>` to pick a specific agent.
