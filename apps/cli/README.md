**Expect** is a skill for testing your agent's code in a real browser.

### **[Demo →](https://expect.dev)**

## Getting Started

1. Ask your agent to `Fetch https://www.expect.dev/ and run init script`
2. Run `/expect` inside Claude Code, Codex, [and more](https://github.com/millionco/expect#supported-agents)
3. Expect spawns subagents simulating real logged-in users to find issues and regressions
4. Your agent will fix any issues Expect finds, then re-run to verify

## FAQ

#### 1. What is Expect?

A skill that reads your git changes, generates a test plan, and runs it in a real browser with Playwright. It hooks into your existing agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) and runs entirely on your machine. It checks for performance (long animation frames, INP, LCP), security (npm deps, CSRF attacks, vulns), design tweaks (broken hover states, links, buttons), and app completeness (missing metadata, dead links).

#### 2. Why not just use Puppeteer, Playwright, or Cypress?

Instead of writing scripts, maintaining selectors, and wiring up assertions, Expect reads your code changes and tests them in a real browser automatically. It's like giving your agent QA superpowers.

#### 3. How is this different from computer-use agents?

General-purpose browser tools rely on screenshots and mouse coordinates. Expect is purpose-built for testing: it uses Playwright for fast DOM automation, reads your code changes, generates a test plan, and runs it with your real cookies, then reports back what's broken so the agent can fix it.

#### 4. Does it work in CI?

Yes. Use `--ci` or the `add github-action` command to set up a workflow that tests every PR. In CI mode it runs headless, skips cookie extraction, auto-approves the plan, and enforces a 30-minute timeout.

#### 5. Does it support mobile testing?

Coming soon.

#### 6. Is there a hosted or enterprise version?

Coming soon. Email [aiden@million.dev](mailto:aiden@million.dev) if you have questions or ideas.

## Supported Agents

Expect works with the following coding agents. It auto-detects which agents are installed on your `PATH`. If multiple are available, it defaults to the first one found. Use `-a <provider>` to pick a specific agent.

### Acknowledgements

Expect wouldn't exist without the ideas and work of others:

- [**dev-browser**](https://github.com/SawyerHood/dev-browser) by Sawyer Hood — the Playwright-first ("bitter lesson") approach that inspired Expect's core design: give the agent real browser APIs instead of screenshots and coordinates.
